<h3>Hello, my name is Rob Lammers and I’m seeking to join an innovative company as a web developer.</h3>
<p>In my 17 years of experience as a front-end web developer, I have become highly proficient in HTML5, CSS3 and Photoshop. I write code from scratch and am very familiar with the Bootstrap framework. I am proficient with the preprocessors LessCSS and SASS. I have a working knowledge of JavaScript, jQuery, and AngularJS.</p>
<p>I regularly assess and adjust my coding practices for the best standards of the time. Ranging back from table based layouts in Netscape 4, to fully responsive sites on a wide variety of platforms.</p>
<p>I have experience working with a proprietary CMS system. I feel as though developing for its idiosyncrasies has prepared me to think unconventionally to achieve end goals. I have worked with Wordpress and it’s closest ColdFusion based cousin Mango Blog. I don’t consider myself a back-end programmer, but I’m used to navigating through various files. I’m most familiar with ColdFusion and PHP, but I’m not particularly tied to any back-end language.</p>
<p>Personally, I have a strong work ethic, attention to detail, desire to innovate, and have strong team collaboration skills. I would be an excellent fit for your team.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time and consideration. <a ng-href="#/resume">Please contact me with any questions</a>.</p>
