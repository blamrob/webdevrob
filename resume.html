<p>When I joined Interactive Sites I was in a department dedicated to maintaining several hundred hotel websites for Starwood Hotels &amp; Resorts. In a short time I advanced in my position to become a member of the new site development team. I was in charge of continuously streamlining our front end build practices for our proprietary content management system. I am also proficient in additional site and banner design in Photoshop and user experience mock-ups.</p>

<h3>Notable achievements:</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Created and maintained our internal site boilerplate for new builds. A basic foundation of web standards and useful plugins.</li>
	<li>Designed and built a system of standard components for our content management system. The building blocks our clients used to create unique page layouts without having to know how to code.</li>
	<li>Introduced the company to progressive technologies and processes like responsive web development, Bootstrap, and Angular JS.</li>
</ul>
