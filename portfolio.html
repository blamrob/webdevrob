<h2>Hotel Zelos</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.hotelzelos.com/" target="_blank">http://www.hotelzelos.com/</a></p>
<p>I was responsible for the front-end build of this site. This is a fully responsive website with interesting CSS transitions and animation. The design was adapted from Photoshop files created by our designer, but the various responsive states needed to be created during development. I worked with the designer, the client and our account managers to find the best solution to these challenges.</p>
<p>This site became a template for other hotels owned by this management company. Each property would get a light reskin of this design to fit their style.</p>

<p>This replaces the previous template I had created for them as well.</p>

<p>This build was also fully responsive. The client was very happy with these sites at the time. I think they’re good builds that were just due for a refresh.</p>

<p>This is a web application for hotels to book and process meeting proposals. I was responsible for the front-end build of this application. It’s fully responsive. I also created a custom font-based icon set to use. Many of the initial icons were SVGs obtained through The Noun Project, but I had a hand in cleaning up each the vector files. Some were made a little more simple to read better at smaller sizes, some were mixed and matched to create new ones, and a few were entirely new.</p>

<h2>Experience</h2>

<p>This is a web based mobile app for guests who check in to a hotel to get more information about it. It has important phone numbers they can click to dial, information on things to do and places to eat. Both on property and locally. I was responsible for the initial static build of this application. While not fully responsive, this site is intended to be used by guests on their phone.</p>
<p>An updated fully responsive version of this site is in progress.</p>

<h2>Miraval Resort &amp; Spa</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.miravalresorts.com/" target="_blank">http://www.miravalresorts.com/</a></p>
<p>A sophisticated Tucson resort &amp spa. I built the front end of this fully responsive site.</p>

<h2>Enchantment Resort</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.enchantmentresort.com/" target="_blank">http://www.enchantmentresort.com/</a></p>
<p>An extravagant destination resort and spa. I built the front end for this fully responsive site.</p>

<h2>More...</h2>
<p>Miscellaneous clients I've worked for over the years. Sadly most of which are no longer live.</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Rosewood Hotels &amp; Resorts</strong> - We built and maintained sites for this property management company and their boutique hotels and resorts for nearly 10 years. Over that time we would redesign and build their sites every 2-4 years, at the clients request to keep things clean and new. Sadly this great client was lost when they were sold to overseas investors.</li>
	<li><strong>The Venetian, Caesars Palace, Planet Hollywood, Golden Nugget, Rio</strong> - We've done work for many Las Vegas hotels &amp; casinos over the years. However, property management companies trade Las Vegas hotels like baseball cards, so they would come and go.</li>
	<li><strong>Jumeirah Hotels</strong> - We developed sites for this management company and their hotels. They have a collection of very prestigious hotels in exotic locations.</li>
	<li><strong>Marley Resort &amp; Spa</strong> - A boutique hotel started by the children of the revered Bob Marley.</li>
	<li><strong>Wolfgang Puck, Southwest Jet Center, ASU Karsten</strong> - Occasionally we would get outside of our hospitality niche.</li>
</ul>
